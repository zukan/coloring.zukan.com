# Notes for Future Agents

## Article Copies / Long-term Preservation
- Avoid archive-heavy wording like "archive"/"保存版"; keep UI text neutral.
- Do not add "取得日"; only show the original publish date if needed.
- Do not link to upstream URLs that may disappear; if necessary, keep the URL as plain text in the footer.
- Keep URLs short and stable (avoid extra prefixes/suffixes).
- Only create an index/list page if explicitly requested.
- Use a shared stylesheet (no inline `<style>` in article pages).
- Keep the header minimal, with a link back to the site top.
- Optimize images for the web (resize down, then compress).
